This program takes a raw sqlite3 database from FIA Datamart and re-organizes it so that it can be run through FVS. 
We have it setup for New Jersey, but it is configurable for other states - there are example configs for MD and WY.
Check out the [wiki page](https://github.com/New-Jersey-Forest-Service/ForMOM/wiki/FVS#inputs) for more information on running it.

**Credits**: The actual re-organization process was thought of and developed by Lauren and Courtney, it was only automated by Michael.




## Running

The file to run is DBRebuild_Main.py, you can find more instructions on the github wiki.
